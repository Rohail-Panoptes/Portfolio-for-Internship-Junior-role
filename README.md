Hi guys!
Welcome to my little project. I'd like to thank you for checking out my profile. 
This research project is for a portfolio that I want to send to companies in order to show off some of my skills. 
I want to professionally enter the Offensive Security Research community. 

I want to work in Government because I want to receive training in learning Programming Languages, Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Research. 
I want to reverse Kernel/UEFI drivers and search for vulnerabilities in them. I can do this by running the reversed code into a Static Analyser like CppCheck. 
Furthermore, I want to learn how to write fuzzers and use them against drivers to obtain crashes, that can be investigated for vulnerabilities for exploitation. 

In addition, I want to receive training in creating offensive capabilites akin to creating Kernel/UEFI/Hardware-based rootkits. 

I am 26 years old, and I'm UK-based.
If you're a recruiter, contact me at: Panoptes_blog@hotmail.com/If you have any other email of mine, please do not hesitate contact me. 

Hope you had as much fun looking through my code/reading my articles as I did creating them.
